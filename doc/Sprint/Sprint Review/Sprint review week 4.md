## Main problems Encountered

### Problem 1:

Unable to do client tests because server side was not yet ready

##### improvement:

Make sure we are aware of the inter-branch (test) dependencies 

so we can agree on finish times and be aware on what we need for tests

### Problem 2:

communication was not done properly, the original plan was not well defined enough

##### improvement:

Make better agreements and more specific tasks/deadlines in the plan so we know what people are working on, and people know more specifically what to have done. 

(In general communication/planning were issues and our organization and planning have to be improved by making a more detailed plan and communicate more )
